## Differences with older versions

A difference of WuidebookAPI with GuidebookAPI its not only the in-game creation of guides! The development of older guides of the mod its mostly in java-code, this mod register the Book Information of these in java and then this reads other files for the creation of content!

The old configuration systerm wasn't to different from the new, the principal difference it's the way the de/serializers does the de/serialization. The principal difference it's that developers can register custom serializers for their own custom configurations.
